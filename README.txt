In my WorkoutProject code, it involves $1 USD being converted to different currencies and being visualized on a bar graph.
There are five different currencies where the user is prompted to enter where they would provide the currency code of 
different countries such as CAD (Canadian) or EUR (Euro). They must be of length three since they are currency codes. Even though it 
does work with USD, the program may ask for different currencies to show a better visualization. In my code, the user will
be prompted to enter their own api key for the currency exchange website. After the user enters the prompts, the program will retrieve the data
to be downloaded from the url created and is being written to a text file on the local computer. Then, the code is loading the data 
to only get the currency code and conversion rate of each currency that are in separate lists, which is in a for loop. Then, the currencies will be 
plotted onto a graph, where on the x axis it is the currency codes, and y axis is the conversion amount. Then the user is prompted if they want to run
the program again.
